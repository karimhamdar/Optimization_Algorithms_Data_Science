# Multi-Class Logistic Regression and Optimization Methods for Clustering

## Topic:
### Solving Multi-Class Logistic Regression using:
- Gradient Descent (GD)
- Block Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD) with Randomized Rule
- Block Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD) with Gauss-Southwell (GS) Rule

## Project :
### Optimization Methods for Clustering
This project implements:
- **Frank-Wolfe Algorithm**
- **Pairwise Frank-Wolfe**
- **Away-Step Frank-Wolfe**

The algorithms are applied to ℓ2 and ℓ0 regularized max-clique problems and tested on **DIMACS datasets**.
