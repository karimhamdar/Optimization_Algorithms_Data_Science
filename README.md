# Optimization Algorithms for Multi-Class Logistic Regression and Clustering

## Multi-Class Logistic Regression Project Topic:
### Optimization Techniques for Multi-Class Logistic Regression:
This project explores the implementation and comparison of three distinct optimization techniques to solve multi-class logistic regression problems. 
In this study, we aim to minimize the negative log-likelihood of a given dataset by finding the optimal model parameters using various optimization methods.
e implemented and tested the following optimization methods:
- **Gradient Descent (GD)**
- **Block Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD) with Randomized Rule**
- **Block Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD) with Gauss-Southwell (GS) Rule**

To test and evaluate our algorithms, we used the Dry Bean Dataset and the Microbes Dataset.

## Clustering Project Topic:
### Optimization Methods for Clustering:
This project focuses on solving the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP), a well-known challenge in graph theory.
We implemented optimization algorithms to find approximate solutions.
The algorithms implemented in this project include:
- **Frank-Wolfe Algorithm**
- **Pairwise Frank-Wolfe**
- **Away-Step Frank-Wolfe**

To test and evaluate our algorithms, we used DIMACS datasets, a widely recognized set of benchmarks for graph-related problems.
